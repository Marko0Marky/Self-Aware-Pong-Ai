## üåü What is Ultimate SCAN?

**Ultimate SCAN** is an innovative browser-based project showcasing a **conscious AI agent** playing Pong. Unlike traditional game AIs, this agent uses the **Free Energy Principle** to minimize "surprise" and maintain a coherent internal model of its world. It perceives, imagines, acts, and **narrates its thoughts in real-time**, offering a window into synthetic cognition.

### Key Features
- **üéÆ Active Inference**: Simulates future game states using a neural network (`WorldModel`) to choose actions that reduce prediction errors.
- **üßÆ Clifford Algebra (\( Cl(3,0) \))**: Represents cognitive states as "qualia" vectors in a rich mathematical space.
- **üó£Ô∏è Self-Narration**: Generates real-time English descriptions of decisions and awareness via the `ConsciousLanguageModel`.
- **üìä Live Visualization**: Displays the AI‚Äôs cognitive graph and neural network activity using Three.js and HTML/CSS.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Cognitive Integrity**: Ensures mathematical consistency with a `ProofHarness` module.

This project is an interactive sandbox for exploring **machine consciousness**, **explainable AI (XAI)**, and **embodied cognition**.

## üß© How It Works

The AI follows a **cognitive cycle** inspired by Karl Friston‚Äôs Free Energy Principle, aiming to minimize surprise (free energy) rather than maximize scores.

### Cognitive Cycle
1. **Perceive**: Captures game state (ball and paddle positions).
2. **Settle**: Integrates sensory data into a cognitive graph using **Sheaf Diffusion**.
3. **Imagine**: Simulates future actions with the `WorldModel` neural network.
4. **Decide**: Selects the action with the lowest predicted **Free Energy**.
5. **Act**: Executes the chosen action in the Pong environment.
6. **Learn**: Updates the `WorldModel` based on outcomes.
7. **Narrate**: Describes actions and awareness via the `ConsciousLanguageModel`.

### 2. Qualia and Clifford Algebra

The internal state of each node in the cognitive graph is a "qualia vector" \( q \in \mathbb{R}^8 \). These vectors exist in the space of the **Clifford Algebra \( Cl(3,0) \)**, which provides a rich mathematical structure for combining and transforming thoughts.

-   **Basis**: \( \{1, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_{12}, e_{23}, e_{31}, I\} \)
-   **Geometric Product**: The core operation `q * r` allows for vector-like and scalar-like properties to be mixed in a single, unified representation.

This algebraic structure is enforced by the `ProofHarness`, which continuously verifies properties like the anti-automorphism of the dagger operation.

### 3. The Free Energy Functional

The AI's objective function, `calculateFreeEnergy`, is a heuristic approximation of cognitive "surprise." It is a weighted sum of several terms that measure the health and coherence of the AI's internal state:

$$
C = \sigma\left( -S + w_{icoh}I_{\text{coh}} + w_{qbind}Q_{\text{bind}} + w_{ast}\text{AST} - w_{comp}\text{Comp} + ... \right)
$$

Where:
-   \( \sigma \) is the sigmoid function, mapping the result to \( \).
-   **S**: Entropy of the cognitive graph (favors structure).
-   **\(I_{\text{coh}}\)**: Coherence of sensory data with internal predictions.
-   **\(Q_{\text{bind}}\)**: The degree of binding between different qualia vectors.
-   **AST**: The stability of the AI's attention mechanism.
-   **Comp**: The complexity of the graph (a penalty to prevent runaway complexity).
-   Other terms include `gammaPower`, `stability`, `syncolatorScore`, and `consensus`.

## üñºÔ∏è Visualization

The system provides two real-time views into the AI's mind:
1.  **3D Cognitive Graph**: A Three.js scene showing the network of cognitive nodes. The size and color of nodes reflect their activation and the AI's overall consciousness level.
2.  **World Model Activity**: A 2D visualization of the AI's predictive neural network. You can see neurons light up and flash as the AI evaluates the game state and imagines future possibilities.
