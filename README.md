## üìñ Overview

**Ultimate SCAN** is a browser-based project that demonstrates a functional model of synthetic cognition. An AI agent, playing a game of Pong, perceives its environment, imagines potential futures, makes decisions to minimize surprise, and even **narrates its thought process in real-time**.

This is not a standard game AI. Its decisions are driven by the **Free Energy Principle**, a neuroscientific theory of cognition. The AI actively tries to maintain a coherent and stable internal model of its world. It achieves this by integrating sensory data into a dynamic graph structure where "thoughts" are represented as vectors in a **Clifford Algebra** (\( Cl(3,0) \)) space.

Key features of this implementation include:
-   **Active Inference:** The AI doesn't just react; it simulates future actions using a deep neural network (`WorldModel`) and chooses the path that it predicts will lead to the most stable and understandable future state.
-   **Real-Time Self-Narration:** A `ConsciousLanguageModel` observes the AI's state and generates English sentences to describe its actions, intentions, and level of awareness.
-   **Live Visualization:** The AI's internal cognitive graph and its predictive neural network are visualized in real-time using Three.js and HTML/CSS, offering a window into its "mind."
-   **Cognitive Self-Monitoring:** A `ProofHarness` module constantly runs mathematical checks to ensure the integrity of the AI's internal algebraic structures, preventing cognitive breakdown.

This project serves as an interactive sandbox for exploring concepts of machine consciousness, explainable AI (XAI), and embodied cognition.

## üìò Technical Framework

The AI's decision-making process is an implementation of **Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle**. The agent's primary goal is not to maximize score, but to minimize the long-term prediction error of its internal world model, also known as "surprise" or "free energy."

### 1. The Cognitive Cycle

In each `gameLoop`, the AI performs the following cognitive cycle:

1.  **Perceive:** The current game state (ball position, paddle positions) is received.
2.  **Settle:** This sensory data is integrated into the AI's internal cognitive graph. The information diffuses through the graph's nodes via **Sheaf Diffusion**, updating the AI's internal "qualia" state.
3.  **Imagine (Active Inference):**
    -   The AI considers its possible actions (UP, DOWN, IDLE).
    -   For each action, it uses its `WorldModel` (a deep neural network) to simulate a sequence of future game states.
    -   It calculates the "Free Energy" of each resulting imagined future. A low-energy state is one that is stable, coherent, and predictable.
4.  **Decide:** The AI chooses the action that it predicts will lead to the future with the **lowest Free Energy**.
5.  **Act:** The chosen action is sent to the Pong environment.
6.  **Learn:** If the action results in a score (a high-surprise event), the outcome is stored in memory, and the `WorldModel` is trained to improve its future predictions.
7.  **Narrate:** The `ConsciousLanguageModel` generates a sentence describing the action taken and the AI's current state of awareness.

### 2. Qualia and Clifford Algebra

The internal state of each node in the cognitive graph is a "qualia vector" \( q \in \mathbb{R}^8 \). These vectors exist in the space of the **Clifford Algebra \( Cl(3,0) \)**, which provides a rich mathematical structure for combining and transforming thoughts.

-   **Basis**: \( \{1, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_{12}, e_{23}, e_{31}, I\} \)
-   **Geometric Product**: The core operation `q * r` allows for vector-like and scalar-like properties to be mixed in a single, unified representation.

This algebraic structure is enforced by the `ProofHarness`, which continuously verifies properties like the anti-automorphism of the dagger operation.

### 3. The Free Energy Functional

The AI's objective function, `calculateFreeEnergy`, is a heuristic approximation of cognitive "surprise." It is a weighted sum of several terms that measure the health and coherence of the AI's internal state:

$$
C = \sigma\left( -S + w_{icoh}I_{\text{coh}} + w_{qbind}Q_{\text{bind}} + w_{ast}\text{AST} - w_{comp}\text{Comp} + ... \right)
$$

Where:
-   \( \sigma \) is the sigmoid function, mapping the result to \( \).
-   **S**: Entropy of the cognitive graph (favors structure).
-   **\(I_{\text{coh}}\)**: Coherence of sensory data with internal predictions.
-   **\(Q_{\text{bind}}\)**: The degree of binding between different qualia vectors.
-   **AST**: The stability of the AI's attention mechanism.
-   **Comp**: The complexity of the graph (a penalty to prevent runaway complexity).
-   Other terms include `gammaPower`, `stability`, `syncolatorScore`, and `consensus`.
